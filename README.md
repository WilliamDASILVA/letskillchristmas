# Let's Kill Christmas

Do you hate christmas? I do, so let's kill christmas.
This game is a spaceshooter in the theme of christmas.
Created with LÖVE and Lua during the christmas eve, it's my first game I've done with Lua and LÖVE.
Feel free to play it. It's really enjoyable for 2,3 minutes. After, you can just throw it to the trash. No regrets.
